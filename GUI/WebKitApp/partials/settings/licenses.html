                                       Version 2.1, February 1999

                 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
                 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
                 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
                 the version number 2.1.]

                                            Preamble

                  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
                free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

                  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
                specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
                Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
                can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
                this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
                strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

                  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
                not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
                you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
                for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
                it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
                it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
                these things.

                  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
                rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
                you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

                  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
                or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
                you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
                code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
                complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
                with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
                it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

                  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
                library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
                permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

                  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
                there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
                modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
                that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
                author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
                introduced by others.

                  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
                any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
                effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
                restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
                any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
                consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

                  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
                ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
                General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
                is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
                this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
                libraries into non-free programs.

                  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
                a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
                combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
                General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
                entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
                Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
                the library.

                  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it
                does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
                Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
                of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
                are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
                libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
                special circumstances.

                  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
                encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
                a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
                allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
                library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
                case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
                software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

                  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
                programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
                free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
                non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
                operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
                system.

                  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
                users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
                linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
                that program using a modified version of the Library.

                  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
                &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The
                former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
                be combined with the library in order to run.

                                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

                  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
                program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
                other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
                this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).
                Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

                  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
                prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
                (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

                  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work
                which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the
                Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
                copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
                portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
                straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
                included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)

                  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
                all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
                interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
                and installation of the library.

                  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
                such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
                on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
                writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
                and what the program that uses the Library does.

                  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
                complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
                you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
                appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
                all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
                warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
                Library.

                  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
                and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
                fee.

                  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
                of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
                distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

                    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

                    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

                    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
                    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

                    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
                    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
                    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
                    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
                    in the event an application does not supply such function or
                    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
                    its purpose remains meaningful.

                    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
                    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
                    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
                    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
                    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
                    root function must still compute square roots.)

                These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
                and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
                it.

                Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                collective works based on the Library.

                In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
                with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
                a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                the scope of this License.

                  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
                License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
                this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
                that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
                instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
                ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
                that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
                these notices.

                  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
                that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
                subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

                  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
                the Library into a program that is not a library.

                  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
                derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
                under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
                it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
                must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
                medium customarily used for software interchange.

                  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
                from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
                source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
                distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
                compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

                  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
                Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
                linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a
                work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
                therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

                  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
                creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
                contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the
                library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
                Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

                  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file
                that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
                derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
                Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
                linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
                threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

                  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
                structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
                functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
                file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
                work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
                Library will still fall under Section 6.)

                  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
                distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
                Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
                whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

                  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
                link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a
                work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
                under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
                modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
                engineering for debugging such modifications.

                  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
                Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
                this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
                during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
                copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
                directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
                of these things:

                    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
                    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
                    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
                    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
                    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that
                    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
                    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
                    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
                    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
                    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
                    to use the modified definitions.)

                    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
                    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
                    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
                    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
                    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
                    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
                    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

                    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
                    least three years, to give the same user the materials
                    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
                    than the cost of performing this distribution.

                    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
                    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
                    specified materials from the same place.

                    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
                    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

                  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the
                Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for
                reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
                the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
                normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
                components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
                which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
                the executable.

                  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
                restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
                accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
                use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
                distribute.

                  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
                Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
                facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
                library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
                the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
                permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

                    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
                    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
                    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
                    Sections above.

                    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
                    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
                    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

                  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
                0the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
                attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
                distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
                rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
                or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
                terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

                  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
                prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
                Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                the Library or works based on it.

                  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
                Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
                subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
                this License.

                  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
                license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
                all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

                If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
                particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
                and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

                It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                integrity of the free software distribution system which is
                implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                impose that choice.

                This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                be a consequence of the rest of this License.

                  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
                certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
                an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
                so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
                excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
                written in the body of this License.

                  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
                versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
                Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
                but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

                Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
                specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
                &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
                conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
                the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
                license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
                the Free Software Foundation.

                  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
                programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
                write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
                copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
                Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
                decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
                of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
                and reuse of software generally.

                                            NO WARRANTY

                  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
                WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
                EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
                OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
                KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
                IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
                PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
                LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
                THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

                  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
                WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
                AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
                FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
                CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
                LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
                RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
                FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
                SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
                DAMAGES.

                                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

                  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
                possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
                everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
                redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
                ordinary General Public License).

                  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
                safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
                convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
                &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

                    &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
                    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

                    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
                    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
                    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
                    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

                    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
                    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
                    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
                    Lesser General Public License for more details.

                    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
                    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
                    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

                Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

                You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
                school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if
                necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

                  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
                  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

               As a special exception to the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1, the object code form of a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may distribute such object code under terms of your choice, provided that the incorporated material (i) does not exceed more than 5% of the total size of the Library; and (ii) is limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts, accessors, macros, inline functions and templates.

                               Version 2, June 1991

                 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                                 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
                 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                                Preamble

                  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
                software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
                General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
                using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
                the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
                your programs, too.

                  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
                if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

                  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

                  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                rights.

                  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                distribute and/or modify the software.

                  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                authors' reputations.

                  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

                  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                modification follow.

                            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

                  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

                Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

                  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                along with the Program.

                You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

                  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

                    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

                    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                    parties under the terms of this License.

                    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

                These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

                Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                collective works based on the Program.

                In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                the scope of this License.

                  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

                    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

                    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                    customarily used for software interchange; or,

                    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                    received the program in object code or executable form with such
                    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

                The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                itself accompanies the executable.

                If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

                  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                parties remain in full compliance.

                  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                the Program or works based on it.

                  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                this License.

                  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

                If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                circumstances.

                It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                impose that choice.

                This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                be a consequence of the rest of this License.

                  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

                  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                address new problems or concerns.

                Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                Foundation.

                  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

                  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

                  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
                YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

               TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

               1. Definitions.

                  "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
                  and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

                  "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
                  the copyright owner that is granting the License.

                  "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
                  other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
                  control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
                  "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
                  direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
                  otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
                  outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

                  "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
                  exercising permissions granted by this License.

                  "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
                  including but not limited to software source code, documentation
                  source, and configuration files.

                  "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
                  transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
                  not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
                  and conversions to other media types.

                  "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
                  Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
                  copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
                  (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

                  "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
                  form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
                  editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
                  represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                  of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                  separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                  the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

                  "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
                  the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
                  to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
                  submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
                  or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                  the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                  means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
                  to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
                  communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
                  and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                  Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                  excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                  designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

                  "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                  on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                  subsequently incorporated within the Work.

               2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

               3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                  (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                  use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                  as of the date such litigation is filed.

               4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                  meet the following conditions:

                  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                      stating that You changed the files; and

                  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                      the Derivative Works; and

                  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                      as modifying the License.

                  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                  the conditions stated in this License.

               5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

               6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

               7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

               8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

               9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

               END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.0 - 22 November 2005
                -----------------------------------------------------------

                PREAMBLE
                The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
                development of cooperative font projects, to support the font creation
                efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide an open
                framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with
                others.

                The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
                redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
                fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
                redistributed and sold with any software provided that the font
                names of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives,
                however, cannot be released under any other type of license.

                DEFINITIONS
                "Font Software" refers to any and all of the following:
                    - font files
                    - data files
                    - source code
                    - build scripts
                    - documentation

                "Reserved Font Name" refers to the Font Software name as seen by
                users and any other names as specified after the copyright statement.

                "Standard Version" refers to the collection of Font Software
                components as distributed by the Copyright Holder.

                "Modified Version" refers to any derivative font software made by
                adding to, deleting, or substituting -- in part or in whole --
                any of the components of the Standard Version, by changing formats
                or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.

                "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
                writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

                PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
                Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
                a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
                redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
                Software, subject to the following conditions:

                1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
                in Standard or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

                2) Standard or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
                redistributed and sold with any software, provided that each copy
                contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
                included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
                in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
                binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

                3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
                Name(s), in part or in whole, unless explicit written permission is
                granted by the Copyright Holder. This restriction applies to all
                references stored in the Font Software, such as the font menu name and
                other font description fields, which are used to differentiate the
                font from others.

                4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder or the Author(s) of the Font
                Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
                Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
                Copyright Holder and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
                permission.

                5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
                must be distributed using this license, and may not be distributed
                under any other license.

                TERMINATION
                This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
                not met.

                DISCLAIMER
